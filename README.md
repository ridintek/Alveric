Windows NGINX and PHP FastCGI Process Manager

Since we don't know about Nginx and FastCGI process manager currently. I built this tool to make Nginx and PHP FastCGI processes run as services or scheduled jobs.

You have to download and extract Nginx and PHP manually and then change directory name of Nginx and PHP as their version.

### Usage:
`cscript /nologo httpd.js`

### Notes:
***Requires elevated privileges***
